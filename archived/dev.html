      <strong>Guidelines for undertaking research</strong>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        CIDA holds a <a href="#">complete list of Research programs</a> as well as thier associated ouputs being undertaken internally can be found <a href="#">here</a> along with their related research outputs and links to ethics where applicable.
        <br/><br/>
        The steps needed  research with a view to publishing you will need to do the following:

        <ol>
          <li>Get approval for your director</li>
          <li>Onboard your proposed research using the template at <b>EF/889/776</b>
          <li>Undertake a scoping and analysis</li>
          <li>Brief to concept brief approved</li>
          <li>Access the dataset


        </ol>
        <br/><br/>
        Note that the majority of research undertaken in the Institute utilises the <a href="#">Master Linked Dataset</a>, a linked dataset which includes the NSW Cancer Registry, ACT Cancer Registry, NSW Notifiable Conditions Information Management System, ACT Communicable Notifiable Diseases Management System, Breast Screen NSW, NSW Pap Test Register, NSW Admitted Patient Collection, NSW Emergency Department Data Collection, NSW Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages death registration, NSW Cause of Death Unit Record File, ACT Emergency Department Information System, ACT Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages death registration, ACT Cause of Death Unit Record File, ACT Admitted Patient Care, the NSW Retrospective Radiotherapy Data Set, Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Note that if planning to use the MLD the Data Governance can onboard you into the Dataset, and it will not require Ethics amendments. This is a wide ranging protocol that we use for high volume research outputs.

      <strong>Guidelines for publishing without Ethics</strong>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        The Cancer Institute holds NSWCR assets and has a mandate to report this for quality improvement. You may also seek to publish this work as research but note that you will not be able to ethics

      <strong>Getting access</strong>
      <hr/>
      <div>
         If you are an internal staff member seeking access any of the data assets for the purpose of analytics, you should request access through the <a href="#">Data Governance Team</a>. In most cases, access is restricted to analytics data assets. For many data assets, there are extended usage notes which set out the conditions of internal and external use.
         You can also download a <a href="/cida/assets-report"">complete list of data assets and their associated metadata</a>, or a <a href="/cida/users-report">complete list of users and roles</a> for all data assets.

      <hr/>
      <code>
        # Note the the driver will be "SQL Server" and port will be 1433, as all CI data is currently held on MS-SQL servers.<br/>
        # You will need to know the names of the Server and Database <br/>
        # <br/>

        # <br/>
        tableFromDB = tbl(con, "tableInDB") <br/>
      </code>
      <br/><strong>Accessing data via a REST API</strong>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        To access any of the data assets, you should request access through the Data Governance Team. In most cases, access is restricted to analytics data assets. For many data assets, there are extended usage notes which set out the conditions of internal and external use.
      </div>

      <br/><h5 class="thin">Coding resources</h5>
      <strong>Getting started with R</strong>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        The R programming language is open source, freely available, and highly to suited analytics tasks that range from descriptive statistics through to advanced machine learning. It also has wide ranging capabilities for creating interactive visualisations and camera-ready journal papers. R Studio (the IDE most commonly used to write R code) also has built in support for many languages, including SAS, Latex, C, C++, Haskell, Python, Javascript, HTML and SQL.

        <br/><br/>  There are a number of excellent resources available to start learning R. <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/" target="_blank">DataCamp</a> provides a free introductory course (found <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r" target="_blank">here</a>) and there is also a getting started set of tutorials by Greg Hamel (found <a href="http://hamelg.blogspot.com/2015/10/introduction-to-r-index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. The Hamel tutorials are also available in Python using Jupyter notebooks, thus providing an opportunity to compare the differences between these two languages. Both Python and R are excellent choices for data science and it will not hurt to learn them both. If you are looking for good ways to ensure clean documentation of you code (which you should be doing!) also read through Hadley Wickham's article on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd.html" target="_blank">auto-generating Rd files</a>. The CIDA project will also be seeking to obtain a site wide licence for <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">DataCamp</a> which provides many data science courses in R and Python.

        <br/><br/>
          Resources can also be found on MOOC sites such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">EDx</a>. An excellent starting point is the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science" target="_blank">John Hopkins University Data Science Specialisation</a>, 10 courses which cover a wide range of data science practics and feature R. There are also a number of other related Data Science courses from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/jhu" target="_blank">John Hopkins University</a> and an excellent course in mathematics for machine learning from <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning" target="_blank">Imperial College London</a>. All courses can be audited with no cost.

        <br/><br/>
        Another excellent resource is the <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/" target="_blank">Applications of Statistical Learning</a> course by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. This resource provides two in depth text books covering statistical and machine learning with applications in R, along with 15 hours of lectures. Note that a solid background in statistics is assumed, and concepts are explained through a statistical lens (many other Machine Learning courses tend to utilise ideas more directly from Calculus and Linear Algebra such as the one noted above). This is in invaluable resource however, and ideal to undertake after the John Hokpins courses.
      </div>
      <br/><strong>Coding conventions</strong>
      <hr/>
      <div>
          The Institute adheres to coding conventions for R as set out in the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml#functiondefinition" target="_blank">Google R Style Guide</a> and adopts the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank">Tidyverse</a>. These style guides include naming and documentation conventions for variables and functions, extensive information for layout and ordering of code, and commonly used libraries and idioms. Note that if you are buidling Shiny Apps and want them to be hosted on the Institute Shiny Server, they <b>must</b> conform to this style guide. You will find this is not overly onerous and that it makes life easier for everyone, and will make your code cleaner and a joy to work with!

        <br/><br/>The most important aspect of writing code? Readability. This is crtical when writing code in any language and you should always code with this in mind. A great way to work on writing beautiful, clean code is to come along to the R Coders meetup group which meets weekly to pick up lots of great practices.
      </div>
      <br/><strong>Using R for ETL</strong>
      <hr/>
      <div>
          The CIDA project uses the R Package <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank">DPLYR</a> for all data transformation tasks and does not use SQL. DPLYR acts as a data query API, and can connect directly to a wide range of different data formats (including SQL, MongoDB, SAS, CSV, Spark, Hadoop, Kafka etc) and is designed for optimised lazy loading and portability. It is also highly readable and testable. Data transformation tasks of any scope can be carried out using DPLYR and it can generate code in many other languages to carry out data manipulation tasks. An excellence tutorial to use DPLYR can be found on <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/" target="_blank">DataCamp</a>.
      </div>
      <br/><strong>Creating Shiny apps and Notebooks</strong>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        One of the major strengths of R is its ability to create and deploy data analysis in a wide range of different formats. These include web applications, Notebooks, PDF, camera-ready journal papers, etc. If you are building these you should use the available templates which will be made available from this page sooon.

        <br/><br/>As part of the CIDA project, we are currently building a wide range of templates that can be used to quickly get up and running when building data transformation tasks, Shiny Apps, and Notebooks. These include templates for publish ready RBCO visualisations, standard approaches to building apps, notebooks and even ministerial briefs. Developing templates and accompanyting documentation is a great way to get explore the R language and if you want to get involved in this part of the project, contact <a href="mailto:jamie.gabriel@health.nsw.gov.au" target="_top">Jamie Gabriel</a> or <a href="mailto:richard.walton@health.nsw.gov.au" target="_top">Richard Walton</a>.
