            <div class="light">Maple is a user interface focused web application to manage data science and analytics in organisations. Its sets out to solve the problem of tracking data assset, data elements users and user roles, and analytics work streams. It aim to increase the productivity for data scientists while ensuring transparency and security for modern data governance.
              <br/><br/>The demo version of this application application includes only fake user names and profiles, along with sample datasets taken from <a href="#">Kaggle</a>. It  and sample requests and projects. The data in maple is reset periodically.

            <h6>Architecture Overview</h6>
            <div class="light">
              Maple is opinionated as a UI, but it aims to be highly flexible as an approach to analytics architecture. A high level overview of the architecture I usually use can be seen below and has the following components: a Django web application; an R Analytics Server that can serve R and Python notebooks, R function APIs, R Shiny applications; and a web API/microservices to manage the management of data and logging of data use.
              <br/><br/>The Maple project is well suited to scaleability. This version is being hosted Digital Ocean deployments, and is well suited to both single instance deployments with limited data assets, to cloud deployments using microservices such as Kubernetes.
